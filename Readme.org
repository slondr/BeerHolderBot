* Building & Running
This project is managed with Cargo, so just build it with =cargo build= and whatever flags you want.

To run it, grab an API token from ~@BotFather~ on Telegram, and store it in an environment variable called =TELOXIDE_TOKEN=. Then just `cargo run` or execute the binary directly.
